# FlightDelaysandCanelationsDashboard-Tableau

This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. You can find the dataset, dashboard, and report materials along side this file.

Questions I answererd include those pertaining to the following areas:

- Which airports have the most cancelations? Is it realted to the Weather? Security? 
- Which airlines or airports have the worst delays?
Determine which destinations and arrival destinations have the most delays? Doing this using maps is actually pretty difficult, but you may choose an alternative visual to provide this information. Think about what kind of aggregates might work best to determine which airlines and airports are the best and worst in terms of delays.

- What causes delays?
Think about if you work at an airline and you want to decrease delays. What part of the flight causes the most delays? Do these causes vary by airport or time of year?
